## Quick Start - The Easy Way

The simplest way to use Cognautic CLI is to just run the main command and do everything interactively:

### Step 1: Run Cognautic

```bash
cognautic
```

This single command launches the interactive Cognautic CLI interface where you can:

- Set up your API keys on first run
- Choose your preferred AI provider
- Start chatting with AI agents
- Build projects from natural language descriptions
- Analyze existing code
- Configure all settings

### Step 2: Follow the Interactive Setup

On first run, Cognautic will guide you through:

1. Welcome screen and version check
2. API key configuration for your preferred providers
3. Basic preferences setup
4. Quick tutorial of available commands

### Step 3: Start Using AI

Once inside the CLI, you can use simple commands like:

```bash
# Chat with AI
/chat

# Build a new project
/build "Create a web scraper"

# Analyze current directory
/analyze

# Get help
/help
```

**That's it!** No complex command-line arguments needed. Everything happens interactively within the Cognautic interface.
